## Trading Stack for Heap with Trampolines

Some multi-paradigm languages like Javascript are lacking optimization techniques to allow different forms of stack safe recursion. This chapter examines the most important optimizations and demonstrates how stack safe recursion can be achieved through the trampoline approach.

### Compiler optimization strategies

If the recursive step of an algorithm is in tail position, compilers can conduct tail call optimization, i.e. they can share a single stack frame throughout the whole recursive computation and eliminate additional frames. This is not only much more efficient but also avoids exhausting the function call stack for larger recursive computations:

```javascript
const foldl = f => acc => ([h, t]) =>
  h === undefined
    ? acc
    : foldl(f) (f(acc) (h)) (t);
//    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ tail call can share its stack frame with subsequent tail calls
```

Tail call optimization can be further generalized to tail recursion modulo cons (short for constructor). While TCO only kicks in when the recursive step is in tail position TRMC allows the recursive step to be within a value constrcutor, as long as this constrcutor performs an associative operation:

```javascript
const foldr = f => acc => ([h, t]) =>
  h === undefined
    ? acc
    : f(h) (foldr(f) (acc) (t));
//          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ recursive step can share its stack frame with
//                             subsequent steps provided f is associative
```
Please note that in lazily evaluated languages like Haskell TRMC is called guarded recursion and is not an optimization technique but a side effect of lazy evaluation.

### Deferred function call trees

For some recursive functions it is not sufficient to make the algorithm itself stack safe, because the resulting data structure is also stack critical:

```javascript
const compn = fs =>
  fs.reduce((f, g) => comp(f) (g), x => x);

const compn_ = fs => x =>
  fs.reduce((x, f) => f(x), x);

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

const inc = x => x + 1;

const fs = Array(1e5).fill(inc);

const main = compn(fs), // stack safe
  main_ = compn_(fs); // stack-safe
  
main(0); // stack overflow
main_(0); // 100000
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/NoxiousVisibleLanserver)

`compn` creates a deferred nested function call tree, which may exhaust the function call stack once the missing argument is provided. In order to make it stack safe we have to deal with both the recursive algorithm and the recursive data structure it creates.

### Mimicing tail recursion

Trampolines offer a functional interface to write pseudo-recursive algorithms, while under the hood an imperative loop does all the work iteratively. Here is a possible implementation of such a trampoline that mimics tail recursive algorithms:

```javascript
const tailRec = f => (...args) => {
    let step = f(...args);

    while (step.tag !== "Base")
      step = f(...step.args);

    return step.x;
};

const Base = x =>
  ({tag: "Base", x});

const Step = (...args) =>
  ({tag: "Step", args});

const fold = f => acc => xs =>
  tailRec((acc_, i) =>
    i === xs.length
      ? Base(acc_)
      : Step(f(acc_) (xs[i]), i + 1))
          (acc, 0);

const sub = x => y => x - y;

const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1);

fold(sub) (0) (xs); // -100000
```

Another example: A stack safe Fibonacci function using `tailRec`:

```javascript
const fib = n =>
  tailRec((x, y, m) =>
    m > 1
      ? Step(y, x + y, m - 1)
      : Base(x))
          (1, 1, n);
          
fib(10); // 55
```

### Handling deferred function call trees

The trampoline approach is apparently general enough to enable a variety of stack safe recursive algorithms. However, this does not hold for algorithms creating a large deferred function call tree like the variadic `compn` function from the beginning of this chapter:

```javascript
const compn = fs =>
  tailRec((acc, i) => 
    i === fs.length
      ? Base(acc)
      : Step(comp(acc) (fs[i]), i + 1))
          (id, 0);
          
const inc = x => x + 1;
const id = x => x;

const fs = Array(1e5).fill(inc);

const main = compn(fs); // no stack overflow yet

main(0); // stack overflow
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/WillingVivaciousPolyhedron)

Can we prevent the deferred function call tree from exhausting the call stack during evaluation? We need a way to somehow break the composition without losing the ability to compose. Unfortunately we need to modify the original composition combinator and yet another trampoline to achieve the desired behavior:

```javascript
// trampoline

const callRec = step => {
  while (step && step.tag === "Call")
    step = step.f(step.x);

  return step;
};

const Call = f => x =>
  ({tag: "Call", f, x});

// auxiliary functions

const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

id = x => x;
inc = x => x + 1;

// function composition

const comp = f => g => x =>
  Call(f) (g(x));
//^^^^^^^ adaption

const compn = xs => x =>
  callRec(arrFold(comp) (id) (xs) (x));

// MAIN

const xs = Array(1e5).fill(inc);

compn(xs) (0);
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/StripedFlashyProcessors)

As you can see the trampoline does not leak into the call side, because we were able to hide its invocation inside `compn`. This is not always possible, though. For more complex recursive algorithms several trampoline calls at different places in the code may be necessary. Since `callRec` behaves like the identity function if non-tag values are provided, the mechanism is quite expressive.

### Mimicing tail recursion modulo cons (TRMC)

With functional programming we often have to deal with the situation that a recursive call is part of another function application, i.e. it is not in tail position: `arrCons(x) (recursiveCall(acc))`. The technique to make this kind of recursion stack safe is called tail recursion modulo cons or guarded recursion for lazy evaluated languages respectively. Consequently we cannot use the `tailRec` trampoline. One way to solve this issue is to transform the composition into continuation passing style and we will take a look at this technique in a later chapter of this course. Alternatively we can adapt the mechanism `callRec` is using to render it applicable for TRMC.

In the following example we are going to stop a right-associative fold from blowing the stack for large arrays:

```javascript
const compRec = step => {
  const stack = [];

  while (step && step.tag === "Comp") {
    stack.push(step);
    step = step.g(step.x);
  }    

  return stack.reduceRight(
    (acc, step_) => step_.f(acc), step);
};

const Comp = f => g => x =>
  ({tag: "Comp", f, g, x});

const foldr = f => acc => xs => {
  const go = i =>
    i === xs.length
      ? acc
      : Comp(f(xs[i])) (go) (i + 1);

  return compRec(go(0));
};

const sub = x => y => x - y;

const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1);

foldr(sub) (0) (xs); // 0 (instead of -100000 for the left associative fold)
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/NavyblueLoneConditions)

Can we also express the Fibonacci function in its most naturally recursive form using `rec`? No, because the recursive step is in both arguments of the function:

```javascript
const fibBody = n =>
  n > 1
    ? add(fib(n - 1)) (fib(n - 2))
//        ^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^ recursive steps in both arguments
    : n;
```
TRMC only works if the value of the first argument is known before the recursive step is performed. In order to make `fib` stack safe we have to manually transform it into a tail recursive accumulator-style form.

Please note that the `rec` trampoline goes beyond TRMC by allowing the value constructor to be non-associative like substraction for instance.

### Mimicing indirect or mutual recursion

First I demonstrate indirect recursion using the the classic `even`/`odd` example, because its implementation is more natural and thus easer to comprehend:

```javascript
const mutuRec = step => {
    while (step.tag !== "Base")
      step = step.f(...step.args);

    return step.x;
};

const Base = x =>
  ({tag: "Base", x});

const Mutu = f => (...args) =>
  ({tag: Mutu, f, args});

const even = Mutu(n =>
  n === 0
    ? Base(true)
    : odd(n - 1));

const odd = Mutu(n =>
  n === 0
    ? Base(false)
    : even(n - 1));

mutuRec(even(1e5)); // true
mutuRec(odd(1e5)); // false
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/WeeklyScornfulBruteforceprogramming)

As you can see the trampoline API for `mutuRec` leaked into the calling site of the code. Unfortunatelly there is no way to avoid this. However, `even(1e5)` and `odd(1e5)` are lazy evaluated, i.e. we can fully define them and enforce their evaluation later when needed.

In order to make the mutual recursive Fibonacci algorithm stack safe using a suitable trampoline we have to apply a CPS transformation first to bring all recursive steps in tail position. I omit the CPS transformation step because we will examine this technique in a later chapter of this course:

```javascript
const fib = n =>
  fibParent(n, x => Base(x));

const fibChild = Mutu((n, k) =>
  n < 1
    ? k(1)
    : fibParent(n - 1, k));

const fibParent = Mutu((n, k) =>
  n < 1
    ? k(0)
    : fibParent(n - 1, m => fibChild(n - 1, m_ => k(m + m_))));

mutuRec(fib(10)); // 55
```
