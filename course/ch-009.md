## Trading Stack for Heap with Trampolines

**[Editor's note: this chapert is under edit]**

Some multi-paradigm languages like Javascript are lacking optimization techniques to allow different forms of stack safe recursion. This chapter examines the most important optimizations and demonstrates how stack safe recursion can be achieved through the trampoline approach.

### Compiler optimization strategies

If the recursive step of an algorithm is in tail position, compilers can conduct tail call optimization, i.e. they can share a single stack frame throughout the whole recursive computation and eliminate additional frames. This is not only much more efficient but also avoids exhausting the function call stack for larger recursive computations:

```javascript
const foldl = f => acc => ([h, t]) =>
  h === undefined
    ? acc
    : foldl(f) (f(acc) (h)) (t);
//    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ tail call can share its stack frame with subsequent tail calls
```

Tail call optimization can be further generalized to tail recursion modulo cons (short for constructor). While TCO only kicks in when the recursive step is in tail position TRMC allows the recursive step to be within a value constructor, as long as this constructor performs an associative operation:

```javascript
const foldr = f => acc => ([h, t]) =>
  h === undefined
    ? acc
    : f(h) (foldr(f) (acc) (t));
//          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ recursive step can share its stack frame with
//                             subsequent steps provided f is associative
```
Please note that in lazily evaluated languages like Haskell TRMC is called guarded recursion and is not an optimization technique but a side effect of lazy evaluation.

### Deferred function call trees

For some recursive functions it is not sufficient to make the algorithm itself stack safe, because the resulting data structure also affects the call stack:

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

const id = x => x;

const compn = fs =>
  fs.reduce((f, g) => comp(f) (g), id);

const inc = x => x + 1;

const fs = Array(1e5).fill(inc);

const main = compn(fs);
  
try {main(0)}

catch(e) {
  console.log(e.message);
}
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/NoxiousVisibleLanserver)

`compn` creates a deferred nested function call tree, which may exhaust the function call stack once the missing argument is provided. In order to make it stack safe we have to deal with both the recursive algorithm and the recursive data structure it creates.

### Mimicking tail recursion

Trampolines offer a functional interface to write pseudo-recursive algorithms, while under the hood an imperative loop does all the work iteratively. Here is a possible implementation of such a trampoline that mimics tail recursive algorithms:

```javascript
const tailRec = f => x => {
    let step = f(x);

    while (step.tag !== "Base")
      step = f(step.x);

    return step.x;
};

const Base = x =>
  ({tag: "Base", x});

const Step = x =>
  ({tag: "Step", x});

const fold = f => acc => xs =>
  tailRec(([acc_, i]) =>
    i === xs.length
      ? Base(acc_)
      : Step([f(acc_) (xs[i]), i + 1]))
          ([acc, 0]);

const sub = x => y => x - y;

const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1);

fold(sub) (0) (xs); // -100000
```

Another example: A stack safe factorial function using `tailRec`:

```javascript
const fact = n =>
  tailRec(([acc, m]) =>
    m === 0
      ? Base(acc)
      : Step([acc * m, m - 1]))
          ([1, n]);

fact(5); // 120
```

### Mimicking body recursion

Up to now we can only render tail recursive algorithms stack safe. In an strictly evaluated environment like Javascript we also want to be able to conduct an optimization that has a similar effect as tail recursion modulo cons. In order to achieve this we need another trampoline with a custom call stack. Here is the naive body recursive factorial function:

```javascript
// trampoline

const bodyRec = o => {
  const stack = [];

  while (o.tag === "Stack") {
    stack.push(o);
    o = o.g(o.stack);
  }    

  return o.tag === "Unstack"
    ? stack.reduceRight(
        (acc, p) => p.f(acc), o.unstack)
    : _throw(new TypeError("unknown trampoline tag"));
};

const Stack = f => g => stack =>
  ({tag: "Stack", f, g, stack});

const Unstack = unstack =>
  ({tag: "Unstack", unstack});

// fact function

const fact = n =>
  n === 0
    ? 1
    : n * fact(n - 1);

const fact = m => {
  const go = n =>
    n === 0
      ? Unstack(1)
      : Stack(mul(n)) (go) (n - 1);

  return bodyRec(go(m));
};

// auxiliary functions

const mul = x => y => x * y;

const _throw = e => {
  throw e;
};

// MAIN

fact(5); // 120
```

It turns out that `callRec` is a pretty general solution and we can adapt it to properly mimic tail recursion modulo cons as well. In the following example we are going to stop a right-associative fold from building up a huge call stack for large arrays:

```javascript
const compRec = step => {
  const stack = [];

  while (step && step.tag === "Comp") {
    stack.push(step);
    step = step.g(step.x);
  }    

  return stack.reduceRight(
    (acc, step_) => step_.f(acc), step);
};

const Comp = f => g => x =>
  ({tag: "Comp", f, g, x});

const foldr = f => acc => xs => {
  const go = i =>
    i === xs.length
      ? acc
      : Comp(f(xs[i])) (go) (i + 1);

  return compRec(go(0));
};

const sub = x => y => x - y;

const xs = Array(1e5).fill(1);

foldr(sub) (0) (xs); // 0 (instead of -100000 for the left associative fold)
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/NavyblueLoneConditions)

This solution is still surprisingly simple. Essentially we deferred the composition by encoding it as a data type and added a custom stack to the trampoline. This stack is wind up with partially applied functions until the base case is reached and then unwind again by applying the accumulator. We have successfully managed to keep the trampoline API from leaking into the call side, but once again, this is not always possible.

By deferring the composition we used a form of non-strict evaluation to avoid stack overflows, hence the reference to guarded recursion in lazy evaluated languages like Haskell. In strictly evaluated languages the call stack can be optimized by tail recursion modulo cons (TRMC), a technique which is based on the associativity of the "cons"-structor operation. Please not that Javascript neither supplies tail call nor TRMC optimization.

Independently of the evaluation strategy we can always transform a body recursive algorithm into a tail recursive one by encoding it in continuation passing style (CPS). We will take a look into CPS in a later chapter of this course.

### Handling deferred function call trees

The trampoline approach is apparently general enough to enable a variety of stack safe recursive algorithms. However, we are still not able to process deferred function call trees in a stack safe manner:

```javascript
const compn = fs =>
  tailRec((acc, i) => 
    i === fs.length
      ? Base(acc)
      : Step(comp(acc) (fs[i]), i + 1))
          (id, 0);
          
const inc = x => x + 1;
const id = x => x;

const fs = Array(1e5).fill(inc);

const main = compn(fs); // no stack overflow yet

main(0); // stack overflow
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/WillingVivaciousPolyhedron)

How can we prevent this behavior? We need a way to somehow break the composition without losing the ability to compose. This requires the modification of the `comp` combinator as well as a new specialized trampoline:

```javascript
// trampoline

const callRec = step => {
  while (step && step.tag === "Call")
    step = step.f(step.x);

  return step;
};

const Call = f => x =>
  ({tag: "Call", f, x});

// auxiliary functions

const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

id = x => x;
inc = x => x + 1;

// function composition

const comp = f => g => x =>
  Call(f) (g(x));
//^^^^^^^ adaption

const compn = xs => x =>
  callRec(arrFold(comp) (id) (xs) (x));

// MAIN

const xs = Array(1e5).fill(inc);

compn(xs) (0); // 100000
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/StripedFlashyProcessors)

As you can see the trampoline does not leak into the call side, because we are able to hide its invocation inside `compn`. This is not always possible, though. For more complex recursive algorithms several trampoline calls at different places in the code including the call side may be necessary. Since `callRec` behaves like the identity function if non-tag values are provided, the mechanism comes in quite handy.

### Mimicking indirect or mutual recursion

First I demonstrate indirect recursion using the the classic `even`/`odd` example, because its implementation is more natural and thus easer to comprehend:

```javascript
const mutuRec = step => {
    while (step.tag !== "Base")
      step = step.f(step.x);

    return step.x;
};

const Base = x =>
  ({tag: "Base", x});

const Mutu = f => x =>
  ({tag: "Mutu", f, x});

const even = Mutu(n =>
  n === 0
    ? Base(true)
    : odd(n - 1));

const odd = Mutu(n =>
  n === 0
    ? Base(false)
    : even(n - 1));

mutuRec(even(1e5)); // true
mutuRec(odd(1e5)); // false
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/WeeklyScornfulBruteforceprogramming)

This is the first example for trampoline API leaking into the call side of the code. You can think of `even(1e5)` and `odd(1e5)` as being lazily evaluated values: They are only inspected when `mutuRec` triggers the evaluation.

Finally, the Fibonacci sequence as a pseudo-mutual-recursive algorithm. It requires some CPS transformation so it is a bit hard to follow if you are unfamiliar with this encoding:

```javascript
const fib = n =>
  fibParent([n, x => Base(x)]);

const fibChild = Mutu(([n, k]) =>
  n < 1
    ? k(1)
    : fibParent([n - 1, k]));

const fibParent = Mutu(([n, k]) =>
  n < 1
    ? k(0)
    : fibParent([
        n - 1,
        m => fibChild([
          n - 1,
          m_ => k(m + m_)])]));

mutuRec(fib(10));
mutuRec(fib(10)); // 55
```

Please note that the same trampoline can be used for stak safe recursion inside a monad. I will demonstrate its use in the corresponding monad chapter of this course.
