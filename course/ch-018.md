## Composing Monadic Effects with Transformers

Monadic effect composition is one of the more difficult topics of the functional paradigm and quite frankly, it is a bit hackish and still too ad-hoc. It needs a lot of experience to apply the technique properly. Prepare to get your hands dirty in this chapter.

### Monads do not compose in general

As opposed to functors and applicatives monads of different type do not compose, that is, there is no general, mechanical way to combine any two monads so that the result is always a new, lawful monad. We cannot just write,

```
// mmx has type M<N<A>> where M and N are monads of different type

chain1(mmx) (mx => // M structure
  chain2(mx) (x => // N structure
    ...));
```
because some compositions will not work at all, whereas others will break the monad laws and behave unexpectedly.

The problem arises from the fact that monads allow interference between effects and values. The application of `A => M<N<B>>` with `M<N<A>>`, where `M<N<B>>` may depend on a value of type `A`, leads to the intermediate result `M<N<M<N<B>>>>`:

```javascript
// unoin constructor

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

// OPTION

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});

const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// functor

const optMap = f => tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: _ => None,
    Some: ({some: x}) => Some(f(x))
  });

// ARRAY

// functor

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

// MAIN

const foo = s => [ Some(s.toUpperCase())]; // monadic action
//          A => M<N   <B              >>

const ttx = [ Some("foo")];
//          M<N   <A    >>

arrMap(optMap(foo)) (ttx); // [ Some<[ Some<string>]>]
//                            M<N   <M<N   <B     >>>>
```

It is an intermediate result, because we need to get rid of the additional nested monadic structure. Joining two layers of structure is what distinguishes a monad from a mere functor. On the one hand we cannot just join the `M` and `N` structures, because they are of different type. On the other hand we cannot just swap the inner types to get `M<M<N<N<B>>>>` either, because this would require all monads to be commutative. So we are stuck with `M<N<M<N<B>>>>`. In order to join the structures anyway we need to know at least the type of `N`.

### Higher order monads to the rescue

If we know the type of `N` we can incorporate the corresponding join logic into the monad. All that is misisng now is the outer monad `M`. Since `N` should work with any monad we need to provide `M` as an argument. This yields an higher order monad, better known as monad transformer. `N` is the transformer itself or the known monad and `M` is called the base monad.

#### Monad/transformer relation

Even though monad transformers often share the name with their underlying, single monad there is no one-to-one relationship between them. A data type with a single monad instance might have one, several or no meaningful transformer instance at all. However, transformers are monads themselves and hence must comply with the monad laws.

#### Monad transformer under the hood

The simplest form of a monad transformer `T` for the underlying monadic type `M` at the term level is a specific implementation of the monad operations `chain`/`of`:

```javascript
const ofT = ofN => x => /* function body */
const chainT = chainN => mmx => fmm => /* function body */
```
As you can see the type signatures of the transformer operations differ from those of its underlying, single monad by the first formal parameter, which represents the respective operation of the base monad. Now it might be tempting to just incorporate `M`'s `chain` and `of` operations into `T`s implementation. But as I have already mentioned there is no one-to-one relationship between both. A transformer and its underlying monad may resemble each other in parts of their effect, but ultimately they are completely different things. You have to build each transformer operations from scratch. It is also important to understand that `T` must not know anything about its argument `N`, except that it is also a monad.

### Effect interleaving

Technically speaking the known monad of the transformer stack is the inner one, whereas the base monad is the outer one of the composition:

```javascript
const ofT = ofN => x => ... // creates a value of type
//   <M    <N     <A>>>
```
At the effect layer, however, there is no static inner-outer effect nesting. Depending on the monad transformer type effects are interleaved in different ways. As a rule of thumb you can expect the base monad to provide the predominant effect, though.

Please note that monad transformers are not commutative, i.e. `M<N<A>>` is not the same as `N<M<A>>`. With monad transformers ordering matters.

### Monad transformer stacks

The monad transformer mechanism is composable, i.e. you can take a partially applied `chainT` or `ofT` operation and apply it to another one. In functional programming jargon this forms a monad transformer stack. Just like for a single monad transformer the base monad of the innermost transformer determines the predominant effect of the stack.

#### `EitherT`/`Array` stack

`EitherT` is often used to indicate that a computation may yield an error. Along with `Array` as base monad it is a computation that may yield zero one or multiple errors:

```javascript
// union constructor

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  tx.tag in o
    ? o[tx.tag] (tx)
    : _throw(new TypeError(`unknown union property "${tx.tag}"`));

// ARRAY

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

const arrAp = tf => xs =>
  arrFold(acc => f =>
    arrAppend(acc)
      (arrMap(x => f(x)) (xs)))
        ([])
          (tf);

// Monad

const arrChain = mx => fm =>
  arrFold(acc => x =>
    arrAppend(acc) (fm(x))) ([]) (mx);

const arrOf = x => [x];

// EIHTER

const Either = union("Either");

const Left = left =>
  Either(Left, {left});

const Right = right =>
  Either(Right, {right});

// Transformer

const eithChainT = ({chain, of}) => mmx => fmm =>
  chain(mmx) (mx =>
    match(mx, {
      Left: ({left: x}) => of(Left(x)),
      Right: ({right: y}) => fmm(y)
    }));

const eithOfT = of => x => of(Right(x));

// transformer stack

const arrEithChain = eithChainT(
  {chain: arrChain, of: arrOf});

const arrEithOf = eithOfT(arrOf);

// auxiliary functions

const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

const introspect = x =>
  Object.prototype.toString.call(x).slice(8, -1);

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  introspect(ys) === "Array"
    ? xs.concat(ys)
    : _throw(new TypeError("illegal argument type"));

const arrCons = x => xs =>
  [x].concat(xs);

const _throw = e => {
  throw e;
};

// MAIN

const ttx = [Right(10), Left("div by zero"), Right(20)],
  tty = [Right(2)],
  ttz = [Right(0)];

const main = arrEithChain(ttx) (x =>
  arrEithChain(tty) (y =>
    y === 0
      ? [Left("div by zero")]
      : arrEithOf(x / y)));

const main2 = arrEithChain(ttx) (x =>
  arrEithChain(ttz) (z =>
    z === 0
      ? [Left("div by zero")]
      : arrEithOf(x / z)));

main; // [Right(5), Left("div by zero"), Right(10)]
main2; // [Left("div by zero"), Left("div by zero"), Left("div by zero")]
```

Please note that `EitherT` is not limited to error encoding. It can just as well distinguish even from odd numbers, for instance.

#### `ArrayT`/`Either` stack

Monad transformers are an algebraic structure, that is to say they require an algebraic type to create lawful monad transformers. Arrays, however, are not algebraic but imperative. An algebraic array would just be a mapping function from integers to values with rather inefficient runtime behavior. If we take Javascript arrays themselves the only way to reconcile them with the algebraic laws would consist in nesting `[A, [A, []]]`, which yields a linked list instead of an array. A nested array is an algebraic type, because it enforces order element can be looked up in and has the empty array to represent the end-of-list case.

While we cannot transform imperative arrays into algebraic ones we can still implement monad transformer-like operations if we arrange the effects cleverly. I want to stress that this requires a great deal of pragmatism and the resulting transformer is probably not valid for all possible base monads.

I came up with the type `M<[M<A>]>`, which wraps both the entire array and each element `A` into the base monad `M`. With the latter we cover the empty case, although in a somewaht weired way, because the effect takes place fisrt, not last. This might lead to undesirable semantics with some monad instances but it ensures that even for an empty array at least one effect is performed.

```javascript
// MAIN

const foo = x =>
  x === 0
    ? [[0, 1]]
    : [[0], [1]];

const lhs = arrArrChain(arrArrChain(foo(0)) (foo)) (foo); // left-associative
const rhs = arrArrChain(foo(0)) (x => arrArrChain(foo(x)) (foo)); // right-associative

lhs; // yields [[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0,1],[0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,1]]
rhs; // yields [[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1],[0,1,1,0,1],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,1]]
```

As you can see the left- and right-associative computation do not yield the same result and thus violate the associative law.

#### Lawful `ListT`/`Either` stack

Does this mean we cannot compose arrays and their non-deterministic effect? Fortunately we can, because arrays are isomorphic to `List`s, which have a lawful transformer instance. Being isomorphic means that there are two functions `arrFromList` and `listFromArr` that allow converting between both types:

```javascript
const listFromArrT = xs =>
  xs.reduceRight((mmx, x) => ConsT(arrOf) (x) (mmx), NilT(arrOf));

const arrFromListT = arrFold(acc => ({head, tail}) =>
  head === undefined
    ? acc
    : Comp(arrAppend(arrSnoc(head) (compRec(acc))))
        (arrFromListT)
          (tail))
            ([]);

// MAIN

const lhs = arrListChain(arrListChain(foo(0)) (foo)) (foo); // left-associative
const rhs = arrListChain(foo(0)) (x => arrListChain(foo(x)) (foo)); // right-associative

compRec(arrFromListT(lhs)); // [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
compRec(arrFromListT(rhs)); // [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
```

Now that we have proven that `ListT` is a lawful monad transformer and we can easily convert from `List` to `ListT` and vice versa let us take a closer look at the more relevant `ListT`/`Either` transformer stack:
