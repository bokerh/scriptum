## Composing Monadic Effects with Transformers

Monadic effect composition is one of the more difficult topics of the functional paradigm and quite frankly, it is a bit hackish and still too ad-hoc. It needs a lot of experience to apply the technique properly. Prepare to get your hands dirty in this chapter.

### Monads do not compose in general

As opposed to functors and applicatives monads of different type do not compose, that is, there is no general, mechanical way to combine any two monads so that the result is always a new, lawful monad. We cannot just write,

```
// mmx has type M<N<A>> where M and N are monads of different type

chain1(mmx) (mx => // M structure
  chain2(mx) (x => // N structure
    ...));
```
because some compositions will not work at all, whereas others will break the monad laws and behave unexpectedly.

The problem arises from the fact that monads allow interference between effects and values. The application of `A => M<N<B>>` with `M<N<A>>`, where `M<N<B>>` may depend on a value of type `A`, leads to the intermediate result `M<N<M<N<B>>>>`:

```javascript
// unoin constructor

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

// OPTION

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});

const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// functor

const optMap = f => tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: _ => None,
    Some: ({some: x}) => Some(f(x))
  });

// ARRAY

// functor

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

// MAIN

const foo = s => [ Some(s.toUpperCase())]; // monadic action
//          A => M<N   <B              >>

const ttx = [ Some("foo")];
//          M<N   <A    >>

arrMap(optMap(foo)) (ttx); // [ Some<[ Some<string>]>]
//                            M<N   <M<N   <B     >>>>
```

It is an intermediate result, because we need to get rid of the additional nested monadic structure. Joining two layers of structure is what distinguishes a monad from a mere functor. On the one hand we cannot just join the `M` and `N` structures, because they are of different type. On the other hand we cannot just swap the inner types to get `M<M<N<N<B>>>>` either, because this would require all monads to be commutative. So we are stuck with `M<N<M<N<B>>>>`. In order to join the structures anyway we need to know at least the type of `N`.

### Higher order monads to the rescue

If we know the type of `N` we can incorporate the corresponding join logic into the monad. All that is misisng now is the outer monad `M`. Since `N` should work with any monad we need to provide `M` as an argument. This yields an higher order monad, better known as monad transformer. `N` is the transformer itself or the known monad and `M` is called the base monad.

#### Monad/transformer relation

Even though monad transformers often share the name with their underlying, single monad there is no one-to-one relationship between them. A data type with a single monad instance might have one, several or no meaningful transformer instance at all. However, transformers are monads themselves and hence must comply with the monad laws.

#### Monad transformer under the hood

The simplest form of a monad transformer `T` for the underlying monadic type `M` at the term level is a specific implementation of the monad operations `chain`/`of`:

```javascript
const ofT = ofN => x => /* function body */
const chainT = chainN => mmx => fmm => /* function body */
```
As you can see the type signatures of the transformer operations differ from those of its underlying, single monad by the first formal parameter, which represents the respective operation of the base monad. Now it might be tempting to just incorporate `M`'s `chain` and `of` operations into `T`s implementation. But as I have already mentioned there is no one-to-one relationship between both. A transformer and its underlying monad may resemble each other in parts of their effect, but ultimately they are completely different things. You have to build each transformer operations from scratch. It is also important to understand that `T` must not know anything about its argument `N`, except that it is also a monad.

### Effect interleaving

Technically speaking the known monad of the transformer stack is the inner one, whereas the base monad is the outer one of the composition:

```javascript
const ofT = ofN => x => ... // creates a value of type
//   <M    <N     <A>>>
```
At the effect layer, however, there is no static inner-outer effect nesting. Depending on the monad transformer type effects are interleaved in various ways. As a rule of thumb you can expect the base monad to provide the predominant effect, though.

Please note that monad transformers are not commutative, i.e. `M<N<A>>` is not the same as `N<M<A>>`. With monad transformers ordering matters.

### Monad transformer stacks

The monad transformer mechanism is composable, i.e. you can take a partially applied `chainT` or `ofT` operation and apply it to another one. In functional programming jargon this forms a monad transformer stack. Just like for a single monad transformer the base monad of the innermost transformer determines the predominant effect of the stack.

#### `EitherT`/`Array`

```javascript
```

#### Illegal `ArrayT`/`Either`

`ArrayT` is not a valid monad transformer, because it only complies with the associative law if the base monad is commutative. Since `Either` is not commutative, the stack would not yield a lawful monad. Here is an example that takes another array as base monad for the sake of simplicity:

```javascript
// MAIN

const foo = x =>
  x === 0
    ? [[0, 1]]
    : [[0], [1]];

// left-associative

const lhs = arrArrChain(arrArrChain(foo(0)) (foo)) (foo);

// right-associative

const rhs = arrArrChain(foo(0)) (x => arrArrChain(foo(x)) (foo));

lhs; // yields [[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0,1],[0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,1]]
rhs; // yields [[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1],[0,1,1,0,1],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,1]]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/NutritiousRowdyWearables)

As you can see the left- and right-associative computation do not yield the same result and thus violate the associative law.

#### `OptionT`/`Array`

Here comes our first monad transformer stack `[Option<A>]`. `OptionT` is the transformer and `Array` the base monad:

```javascript
// union constructor

const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);

// OPTION

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});

const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// Transformer

const optChainT = ({chain, of}) => mmx => fmm =>
  chain(mmx) (mx =>
    match(mx, {
      None: _ => of(None),
      Some: ({some: x}) => fmm(x)
    }));

const optOfT = of => x => of(Some(x));

// ARRAY

// Monad

const arrChain = mx => fm =>
  arrFold(acc => x =>
    arrAppend(acc) (fm(x))) ([]) (mx);

const arrOf = x => [x];

// transformer stack

const optArrChain = optChainT(
  {chain: arrChain, of: arrOf});

const optArrOf = optOfT(arrOf);

// auxiliary functions

const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  xs.concat(ys);

const arrCons = x => xs =>
  [x].concat(xs);

// MAIN

const mmx = [Some(10), Some(20), Some(30)],
  mmy = [Some(0), Some(2), Some(3)];
  
const main =
  optArrChain(mmx) (x =>
    optArrChain(mmy) (y =>
      y === 0 ? [None] // A
        : x % y !== 0 ? [] // B
        : optArrOf(x / y)));

main; // [None, Some(5), None, Some(10), None, Some(15), Some(10)]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/PaleStrictTraining)

The example above exhibits two interleaved effects. The first one consists in `None` values that encode the division-by-zero error (line `A`). The second one consists in a non-deterministic length of the array due to filtered quotients including a fraction (line `B`). 

Please note that usually each monad transformer has its own type wrapper. However, in an untyped environment like Javascript I refrain from doing so. Without a static type system the increased type safety is disproportionate to the continuous wrapping and unwrapping.

#### Illegal `ArrayT`/`Option`

Monat transformers are not commutative, i.e. the interaction of two effects can be controlled by picking a specific stack order. On the one hand the `OptionT`/`Array` stack constitutes an non-deterministic array of independent, optional values, that is, if a single computation inside the array does not yield a result, only this very element becomes `None`. On the other hand the `ArrayT`/`Option` stack constitutes an optional non-deterministic array, that is, if a single computation inside the array does not yield a result, the entire array is dropped and replaced by `None`:


Both examples clearly illustrate the differences. However, `ArrayT`/`Option` is not even a valid monad, because it requires the base monad to be commutative, which `Option` happens to be. Let us look at another example where I use another array as the base monad for the sake of simplicity:



Array is not commutative monad hence the results differ and the monad associative law is broken. You may wonder why I do not present the right implementation - because I do not know it. I am not sure if with an strictly evaluated array it is possible at all to come up with a lawful solution. Implementing new, lawful monad transformer is hard and you should give yourself some time to gain experience.

#### Lawful `ListT`/`Option`

TODO

#### `TaskT`/`OptionT`/`Array`

TODO

#### `ArrayT`/`Either`

Warning: I will cheat in this section. Insteafd of the lawful linked list based transformer stack I am going to use the invalid `ArrayT` implementation, because it is close enough for the purpose of iluustration in the context of this course. `ListT` is just too complex and would contradict this very purpose.
