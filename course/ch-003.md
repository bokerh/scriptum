## Currying, Composition and Point-Free Style

### Functions in curried form

Currying is a simple approach that can be applied in a rather mechanical way. Instead of declaring a single function with several parameters you declare a series of nested functions that each expects a single parameter:

```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
const add_ = x => y => x + y;

add(2, 3); // 5
add(2) (3); // 5
```

A curried function returns another function until all arguments are provided.

### Delimitation of partial application

Currying can easily be confused with partial application used in imperative programming:

```javascript
const partial = (f, ...args) => (...args_) =>
  f(...args, ...args_);

const sum5 = (v, w, x, y, z) => v + w + x + y + z;
const main = partial(sum5, 1, 2)

main(3, 4, 5); // 15
```

`partial` is a sensible implementation of this imperative idiom. It allows deferring the evaluation of a multi argument function by calling it only with a subset of its arguments. The missing arguments are provided with the subsequent call. Currying takes place when a function is declared. It has nothing to do with its application. You cannot partially apply a curried function, because it always expects a single argument. However, it is convenient to say a curried function is partially applied when it returns another function instead of its "final result":

```javascript
const add = x => y => x + y;
const inc = add(1);

inc(2); // 3
```
This is where the confusion comes from.

### Function composition and piping

Currying leads to lots of additional function calls. So why is it useful? It happens to work well with function composition:

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const pipe = g => f => x => f(g(x));
const main = comp(inc) (sub(2));
const main2 = pipe(inc) (sub(2));

main(3); // 0
main2(3); // -2
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/WorldlyElegantAbilities)

With function composition you can build small, specialized functions that each focus on a single concern and combine them to more complex ones. Please note that function composition evaluates from right to left. `pipe` just reverses this order.

A different perspective on function composition is its duality to function application. Loosely speaking composition can be regarded as the dynamic introduction rule of the function type, whereas application is its elimination rule. However, the actual introduction rule of the function type is function declaration of course.

### Abstraction over arity

Since every curried function expects a single argument without exception there is no meaningful notion of arity anymore. Currying abstracts over arity and thus simplifies the functional interface. Let us examine a practical application:

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const add = x => y => x + y;
const inc = x => x + 1;
const main = comp(add) (inc); // (A)
const main2 = comp(add) (add); // (B)

comp(add) (inc) (1) (2); // 4
comp(add) (add) (1) (2); // "y => x + y2"
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/NotableButterySection)

Even though `comp` expects an unary function it can deal with the binary `add` operator. This works as long as the binary function is passed as the first function argument (A). Let us keep composing and see if we can overcome the implicit type error (B):

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const comp2 = comp(comp) (comp);
const add = x => y => x + y;
const main = comp(comp(add)) (add);
const main2 = comp2(add) (add);

main(1) (2) (3); // 6
main2(1) (2) (3); // 6
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/JudiciousSadAgent)

Abstraction over arity allows us to combine curried functions in various ways with only the underlying types acting as limiting. This is a huge win in terms of reusability. Reusing functions is not just a nice theoretical exercise anymore, but becomes the daily routine.

### Composable functions

In order to spare a couple of function calls it is a viable alternative to merely curry a function in its last argument, so that it can maintain composability:

```javascript
const comp = (f, g) => x => f(g(x));
const visualize = s => x => `${s}(${x})`;
const f = visualize("f");
const g = visualize("g");
const h = visualize("h");
const i = visualize("i");
const main = comp(comp(f, g), comp(h, i));

main(2); // f(g(h(i(2))))
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/ImperfectGlitteringLivedistro)

### Variadic functions

Variadic functions are non-deterministic in the number of their arguments, which can range from none, one up to many. There are two classes of variadic functions to be distinguished:

* Array-like
* Tuple-like

Array-like variadic functions collect arguments of the same type and form a homogeneous Array (`(...args: A[])`):

```javascript
const sum = (...xs) => xs.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0);
sum(1, 2, 3); // 6
sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // 15
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/MerryAutomaticServerapplication)

Tuple-like variadic functions collect arguments of different type and form a Tuple (`(...args: [...any[]]`). 

```javascript
const partial = (f, ...args) => (...args_) => // partial has no type because f has none
    f(...args, ...args_);
    
const Quintuple = (v, w, x, y, z) => [v, w, x, y, z];
const main = partial(Quintuple, 123, "foo", true);

main([1, 2, 3], {bar: "baz"}); // [123, 'foo', true, [1, 2, 3], {bar: 'baz'}]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/OliveUnwieldyModules)

While Array-like variadic functions are straightforward in terms of typing, Tuple-like ones lead to more complicated types and increase the need for type casts and explicit annotations. Only use Tuple-like variadic functions with great caution.

### The curry/uncurry isomorphism

There are only two functions necessary to transform a curried function into its uncurried counterpart and vice versa:

```javascript
const curry = f => x => y => f(x, y);
const uncurry = f => (x, y) => f(x) (y);

curry((x, y) => x + y) (2) (3); // 5
uncurry(x => y => x + y) (2, 3); // 5
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/AntiqueHonoredServicepack)

These combinators witness an isomorphism between functions in curried and uncurried form. As a result you can switch back and forth between both forms. Please note that the scriptum library prefers curried functions as default.

### Why parameter order matters

If you declare your own curried functions the argument you want to compose over should be defined as the innermost curried function. Arguments you most likely want to partially apply should be defined as the outermost ones. As a rule of thumb it applies that data is frequently composed over whereas function arguments are partially applied. If you stick to these rules both function composition and partial application will work seamlessly together:

```javascript
const reduce = f => acc => xs =>
  xs.reduce(uncurry(f), acc);

const uncurry = f => (x, y) => f(x) (y);
const sum = reduce(add) (0); // partial application
const main = comp(sqr) (sum); // function composition

sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // 15
main([1, 2, 3]); // 36
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/CadetblueImprobableDatasets)

There is another issue with parameter order along with non-associative operators:

```javascript
const sub = x => y => x â€“ y;
const sub2 = sub(2);

sub(3) (2); // 1 (as expected)
sub2(3); // -1 (1 expected)
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/GiddyWheatCoins)

`sub2(3)` reads like "sub 2 from 3", hence you would expect it to yield `1` instead of `-1`. Either way one use case will exhibit unnatural behavior. Fortunately we can fix this issue by applying the well-known `flip` combinator:

```javascript
const flip = f => y => x => f(x) (y);
const sub2 = flip(sub) (2);

sub2(3); // 1 (as expected)
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/RemarkableAmpleTag)

An alternative to `flip` is `appr`, which mimics operators in infix position:

```javascript
const appl = (x, f) => y => // left section (unnecessary)
  f(x) (y);

const infix = (x, f, y) => x => // infix position
  f(x) (y);

const appr = (f, y) => x => // right section
  f(x) (y);

const sub2 = appr(sub, 2);

infix(3, sub, 2); // 1
sub2(3); // 1
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/FondNoxiousQuery)

We will learn about prefix and infix notation in a later chapter of this course.

### Point-free style

Curried functions used with function composition or other higher order combinators often lead to point-free style code. Point-free means to omit function arguments. Here is a simple example:

```javascript
// auxiliary functions

const id = x => x;
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

const inc = x => x + 1;
const sqr = x => x * x;

// point-free composition

const compn = arrFold(comp) (id);

// MAIN

const main = compn(
  [sqr, inc, inc, inc, inc]);

main(0); // 16
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/StarryIllfatedFile)

Point-free is rather a side effect than something we deliberately aspire to. It is a form of abstraction that is mostly helpful if we can reduce the amount of boilerplate. Boilerplate assumes that we abstract from well-known, recurrent code details. Regarding point-free this means we should only use it with well-known combinators so that other programmers have the chance to decode it.

### Composition in a broader sense

When people encounter a problem that is too complex to be solved at once they recursively decompose that problem into smaller subproblems until the complexity reaches a feasible level. As soon as each individual subproblem is solved, the process must be reversed by recomposing them to solve the original, overall problem. Hence, composition is not only the essence of functional programming but the major strategy of how humans solve complex problems in general. This chapter was mainly about composition of pure functions. In subsequent chapters you will learn how you can compose more complex and less symmetric functions, functions that are a better fit for a chaotic world.
